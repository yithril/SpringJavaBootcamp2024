Let's expand our knowledge!

This will be group work. Your group will be random. Please select one of the following topics.

You will be given 25-30 minutes to research and prepare
the topic to the best of your ability, using any resource available to you.
These topics are quite large, so if you don't get all of it, that's okay!
My goal is to make you aware of what you don't know. 

After you are finished researching, prepare a brief presentation on the topic. 
Your audience is your classmates, so talk to THEM, not your instructor.
Use whatever pictures or aids you can think of to help you get your understanding across.

The additional questions are there to help guide you.

Everyone MUST speak!
