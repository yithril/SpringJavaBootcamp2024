GROUP DISCUSSION

I'd like you to do some research on the design pattern called "Model-View-Controller" or MVC for short.
You can search for it on Google or use ChatGPT or any resource that has the info, it won't be hard to find.

Please answer the following questions:

1. Define MVC in your own words.
2. Define what the Model, View, and Controller are each responsible for.
3. How do the Model, View, and Controller interact?
4. What are some MVC frameworks? You can find frameworks that are not in Java.
5. Why do you think developers use MVC?
