Class Discussion Warm-Up

Part 1: Identifying Common Properties

Today, let's think about something familiar: dogs. Consider different breeds like Poodles, Rottweilers, and Golden Retrievers, etc. Despite their differences, 
they are all dogs. I'd like you to list some properties that all dogs share, regardless of their breed.

Questions to Consider:

    What physical traits do all dogs have in common?
    Do dogs share any common characteristics, like fur color or size ranges?
    What general attributes would you use to describe any dog?

After you've compiled your list for dogs, pick two other categories of your choiceâ€”such as types of cars, trees, or any other group you find interesting. Write down 
what properties members of each group share.

Example Categories:

    Type of Cars (e.g., sedans, SUVs, sports cars)
    Types of Trees (e.g., oak, maple, pine)

Part 2: Identifying Common Behaviors

Now that we've thought about the properties these items or beings share, let's consider what they do. For each category you've chosen (including dogs), 
list out some behaviors or functions that these items or beings typically perform.

Questions to Consider:

    What actions are common to all dogs?
    What are the primary functions or behaviors of the types you listed?
    How do they interact with their environment?

This exercise aims to help you start seeing how we can group things based on shared properties and behaviors. Understanding these concepts will be crucial 
as we delve deeper into our next topics in class.
