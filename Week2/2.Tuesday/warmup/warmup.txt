This morning's warmup is to research about what encapsulation is, its advantages, and disadvantages.
The internet has plenty of stuff on the subject. You can narrow your search to Java, but encapsulation
applies to OOP in general in any language.
Please read through the articles and in your own words explain what you think encapsulation is and
why it might be useful in programming. Discuss with your group.
