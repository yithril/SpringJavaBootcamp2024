Remember, projects go in your workshop folder in your Bootcamp-Labs folder, that way they can be pushed to Github.

For this project you are going to come up with your own pseudo code, but I will give you some food for thought.

The methods you see are going to be in the book class (namely, checkOut and checkIn)

The boolean "isCheckedOut" is true if the book is currently checked out. Therefore, the method "checkOut"
should change the value of isCheckedOut. But what if the book is already checked out? Can a user do that?

Also when you check out a book, you need to know WHO is checking it out. You might need to ask their name!

Have fun coming up with book names, but don't burn yourself out typing. ChatGPT is GREAT for coming up with mock data.
