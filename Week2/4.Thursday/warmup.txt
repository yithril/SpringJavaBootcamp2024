I would like for you to write code to solve the following problem, but here is the catch:

NO INTELLIJ

You MUST do it completely in Notepad (or Notes for the Mac folks). You cannot use IntelliJ to help you with syntax, AT ALL.

Exercise:

Write a for loop to count from 1 to 100. If the number is divisible by 3, print out to the console "Fizz". If the number is divisible by 5 print "Buzz"
If the number is divisible by both 3 AND 5 simultaneously, print out "Fizz Buzz." Otherwise, don't print anything to the console.
