You will be placed into teams. Each team picks 2 of the following exceptions:

    IOException - 
    FileNotFoundException - 
    SQLException - 
    ClassNotFoundException -
    InterruptedException -
    NullPointerException - 
    ArithmeticException - 
    ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException - 
    IllegalArgumentException - 
    IllegalStateException - 
    IndexOutOfBoundsException
    NumberFormatException
    UnsupportedOperationException

Discuss the following:

1. Are they checked or unchecked?
2. When is the exception thrown? (Be sure to use proper vocabulary. 'The exception is thrown when...')
3. Can you find a code snippet online or provide code to show and demonstrate why this exception would be thrown?
