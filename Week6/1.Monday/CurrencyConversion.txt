Activity: Currency Conversion Application

Objective:

Create a Java program that simulates a simple currency converter using BigDecimal. 

Scenario:

Suppose you need to build a program that converts amounts from one currency to another (e.g., USD to EUR, GBP to JPY). The program should handle multiple conversions with different exchange rates.

Task:

Develop a program that:

    Hard-Coded Data:
        Define a set of currencies and their corresponding exchange rates (e.g., 1 USD = 0.85 EUR, 1 GBP = 150 JPY). These can be hard-coded as constants.
        Define a set of amounts in different currencies to be converted.

    Conversions:
        Implement a method to perform currency conversion using BigDecimal.
        Ensure precision in conversion, especially when dealing with large or small amounts.

    Output:
        Display the original amount, target currency, and converted amount for each conversion.

Steps:

    Setup: Create a new Java project and add a main class.

    Defining Constants:
        Define constants for each currency and its exchange rate.

    Implementing Conversion Logic:
        Use BigDecimal for all currency amounts and calculations.
        Create a method to perform the conversion, taking into account the exchange rate.

    Calculations:
        Perform conversions for the predefined set of amounts.

    Output Results:
        Print the results of each conversion, showing both the original and converted amounts.

Sample Starter Code:
    private static final BigDecimal USD_TO_EUR_RATE = new BigDecimal("0.85");
    private static final BigDecimal GBP_TO_JPY_RATE = new BigDecimal("150");
