Activity: Creating a Grid of Cards with Bootstrap

Objective: In this activity, you will practice using the Bootstrap grid system and incorporate card components into your responsive webpage.

Instructions:

Set Up the Project:

Continue working on the same project you started in the previous Bootstrap activity, which includes Bootstrap.
Grid of Cards:

Within your existing webpage layout, create a new section (e.g., <section>) where you want to display a grid of cards. This section can be placed anywhere on your webpage, such as the main content area.
Card Components:

Utilize Bootstrap's card component to create individual cards inside the grid. Each card should include:
An image (replace "your-image-source.jpg" with the actual image source).
A title (modify the text within <h5 class="card-title">).
Some text content (edit the text within <p class="card-text">) describing the card.
You can add any additional elements or content you like within the card.
Grid Layout:

Employ the Bootstrap grid system (.container, .row, .col-*) to organize the cards in a responsive grid within the section you created.
Experiment with different column widths and responsiveness using classes like .col-sm-*, .col-md-*, and .col-lg-* to ensure the grid adjusts well on various screen sizes.
Content and Styling:

Customize the content of each card with your own text and images to make it unique.
If desired, you can add custom CSS styles to enhance the appearance of the cards or adjust Bootstrap classes to align the cards with your design preferences.
Testing:

Open your HTML file in a web browser and test how the grid of cards behaves on different screen sizes. Ensure that the cards stack or resize appropriately on smaller screens.
Documentation:

Feel free to refer to the Bootstrap documentation (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/card/) for more details on customizing card components if you have questions or want to explore additional options.
Share and Discuss:

If you'd like, you can share your grid of cards with the class and discuss how you used the Bootstrap grid system and card components to create a responsive and visually appealing layout.
