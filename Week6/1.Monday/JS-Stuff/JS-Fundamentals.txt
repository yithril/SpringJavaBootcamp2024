JavaScript Fundamentals Review Assignment

Remember to save your file as a .js file, and use the command node <filename.js> to run the program in the terminal so you can 
see the output with console.log

Problem 1: Variables and Conditional Statements

Create a variable temperature and set it to a numerical value representing the current temperature in Celsius. Write an if statement that logs one of the following messages based on the temperature:

    If the temperature is greater than or equal to 30 degrees, log "It's a hot day!"
    If the temperature is less than 30 degrees and greater than or equal to 20 degrees, log "It's a nice day."
    If the temperature is less than 20 degrees, log "It's a cold day."

Problem 2: For Loop and Array

Create an empty array called numbers. Use a for loop to populate the array with numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive). Log the numbers array.

Problem 3: While Loop and Arithmetic

Create a variable sum and set it to 0. Use a while loop to add the numbers from 1 to 10 to the sum variable. Log the final value of sum.

Problem 4: Functions
Write a function called multiply that takes two parameters a and b and returns their product. Call the function with different arguments and log the results.

Problem 5: Functions (Division with Try-Catch)

Write a function called divide that takes two parameters, a and b, and returns the result of dividing a by b. However, use a try-catch block to handle the case where b is 0 (divide by zero). If a divide by zero error occurs, log an error message. Otherwise, return the result. Call the divide function with different arguments to test both successful and error cases.

Problem 5: Arrays (Push, Pop, Shift, and Unshift)

Start with an array called fruits containing some initial values (e.g., ["apple", "banana"]). Perform the following array operations without using try-catch, but make sure to log the array after each operation:

    Push the string "cherry" onto the end of the fruits array.
    Pop an element from the end of the fruits array.
    Unshift the string "grape" to the beginning of the fruits array.
    Shift an element from the beginning of the fruits array.
