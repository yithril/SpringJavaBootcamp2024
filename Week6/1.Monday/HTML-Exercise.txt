Exercise: Create a Basic HTML Web Page

Objective: In this exercise, you will create a basic HTML web page using HTML tags. Follow the instructions below to complete the task.

Instructions:

HTML Structure: Create the basic structure of an HTML document by typing the following code into a text editor. Save the file with the .html extension.

Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Your Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
Page Title: Inside the <title> element (within the <head> section), replace "Your Page Title" with a title of your choice that describes your web page.

Content: In the <body> section, add the following elements to your web page:

Create a main heading using the <h1> tag.
Add a paragraph using the <p> tag with some text describing your page.
Create an unordered list (<ul>) with at least three list items (<li>).
Include a link (<a>) to any website or page you like. Use the href attribute to specify the URL.
Insert an image (<img>) using the src attribute to link to an image file. You can use an image URL from the internet or provide a local image file and specify the file path in the src attribute.
Use the <em> and <strong> tags to emphasize or highlight some text within the paragraph.
Validation: After creating your web page, validate it using the W3C Markup Validation Service (https://validator.w3.org/). Ensure that there are no HTML errors.

Preview: Open your HTML file in a web browser to view the web page you've created.

Sharing: If you like, share your mini website with the class or peers for feedback and discussion.

Requirements:

Use a minimum of the following HTML tags: <html>, <head>, <title>, <body>, <h1>, <p>, <ul>, <li>, <a>, <img>, <em>, <strong>.
Make sure your web page is visually appealing and organized.
