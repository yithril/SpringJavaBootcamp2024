Warmup Activity: Default and Overridden Behavior
Objective:

Practice method overriding in subclasses and understand the role of default implementations in a parent class.
Scenario: Electronic Devices
Instructions:

    Define the Parent Class:
        Create a class ElectronicDevice with a default implementation for the turnOn() method and an abstract method performFunction().

    Create Subclasses:

         Create two subclasses TV and Radio that extend ElectronicDevice.
         Override the turnOn() method in each subclass to provide a specific message.
         Implement the performFunction() method in each subclass with unique functionality.

    In the Main class, instantiate objects of TV and Radio, call their methods, and observe the output.
