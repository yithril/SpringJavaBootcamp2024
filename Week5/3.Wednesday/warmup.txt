Scenario: Imagine you're designing a Restaurant Management System. In this system, there are different components, such as chefs, customers, menus, and orders. Your task is to identify the relationships between these objects.

    Step 1: Identify Objects
        Take a few minutes to list the various objects you might encounter in a restaurant management system (e.g., Chef, Customer, Menu, Order, Restaurant).

    Step 2: Identify Relationships
        Think about how these objects relate to each other. For instance, a restaurant can have many chefs, and an order can contain multiple menu items.
        Determine whether the relationship is:
            One-to-One: An instance of class A has a single instance of class B.
            One-to-Many: An instance of class A has multiple instances of class B.
            Many-to-One: Multiple instances of class A relate to a single instance of class B.
            Many-to-Many: Multiple instances of class A relate to multiple instances of class B.

    Step 3: Suggest Data Structures
        Based on the relationships you identified, suggest which data structures you would use to model them (e.g., arrays, ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet).
