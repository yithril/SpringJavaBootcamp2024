11/1 Warmup

Let's practice decision trees. Decision trees allow us to map out logic and see all the different
paths our logic can take us. Here is an example decision tree:

Is it raining?
  |
  +-- Yes --> Stay at home
  |
  +-- No
       |
       +-- Is it sunny?
       |    |
       |    +-- Yes --> Go to the beach
       |    |
       |    +-- No --> Go for a hike
       |
       +-- Is it cloudy?
            |
            +-- Yes --> Watch a movie
            |
            +-- No --> Go for a walk in the park

You're going to create your own decision tree. This will help you develop your algorithmic thinking
skills. If you don't want to do it as a text file then you can write it out or use whatever software
you want.

Scenario:
You and your friends want to plan an exciting weekend adventure, but you need to decide on the best activity based on various factors. 
Create a decision tree to help you make the decision. Consider the following factors:

    Weather: Is the weather forecast favorable (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy, or snowy)?

    Number of Friends Available: How many friends are available to join the adventure (e.g., 1-2, 3-4, or 5 or more)?

    Adventure Preference: What type of adventure are you in the mood for (e.g., outdoor, indoor, or a mix)?

    Budget: How much money are you willing to spend on the adventure (e.g., low budget, medium budget, or high budget)?

    Travel Distance: Are you willing to travel a long distance for the adventure (e.g., nearby, moderate distance, or far away)?

Use the above factors to design a decision tree that helps you and your friends choose the perfect weekend adventure. You can add your own 
creative options for each factor, such as specific activities, locations, or budget ranges. Be sure to include decision points, branches, 
and outcomes in your decision tree.
