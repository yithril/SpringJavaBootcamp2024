This Thursday I will do a live coding exercise with students individually. This is to prepare you for possible live coding that you may 
need to do at a job interview. The second purpose is to see what you've absorbed over the past few weeks. We've learned all of basic Java,
so I want to make your skills are up to snuff before we move on to JDBC and Spring Boot.

The coding exercise can make use of ANY topic we've discussed in previous weeks. That means basic stuff like 
variables
for loops
while loops
conditional statements
switch statements
making classes
getters and setters
constructors
methods
access modifiers (public, private, protected)
overloading methods and constructors
inheritance 
has-a relationships
abstract classes
abstract methods
overriding
using the Scanner
basic string methods
parsing
try/catch and handling exceptions
checked vs unchecked exceptions
Working with directories in the command line
Basic Git commands

It will last 10 minutes. I will give you a prompt, you will code to the best of your ability, explain why you did what you did, and then we'll have a brief convo.
